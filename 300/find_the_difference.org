Given two strings *s* and *t* which consist of only lowercase letters.

String *t* is generated by random shuffling string *s* and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in *t*.

Example:

#+begin_example
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.
#+end_example

#+begin_src python
  from collections import Counter


  # Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 40.03% of Python3 online submissions for Find the Difference.
  # time complxity: O(tn), tn is the length of `t`
  # space complxity: O(sn), sn is the size of `s_counter`
  class Solution:
      def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
	  s_counter = Counter(s)
	  for char in t:
	      if char not in s_counter or s_counter[char] <= 0:
		  # the `t` only adds one more letter at a random position
		  # we found it and return it
		  return char
	      else:
		  s_counter[char] -= 1

	  return ""
#+end_src
